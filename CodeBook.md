# Code Book - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The ```run_analysis.R``` download the [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone in a experiment carried out with a group of 30 volunteers performing activities of daily living ([more information in project website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)), merges the training and test sets (X_test.txt, y_test.text, subject_test.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt), extracting the measurements on the mean and standard variables, resulting in the following variables:

* subject: identifies the subject who performed the activity. Its range is from 1 to 30
* activity: activity that the subject of the study was doing. Its range is from 1 to 6
* tBodyAcc-mean()-X
* tBodyAcc-mean()-Y

* fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()
* fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-meanFreq()

Information about the variables above (including units) are in the README.txt and features_info.txt files contained in the download.

The activity names were changed to the descriptive form contained in the activity_labels.txt
* 1 WALKING
* 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* 4 SITTING
* 5 STANDING
* 6 LAYING

The variable names were changed to a more "human readable" form (t - time, f - frequency, Acc - Acceleration, Mag - Magnitude, Gyro - Gyroscope) and the special characters (```-``` and ```()```) were removed.

The ```tidy_data``` contains the mean for each selected variable summarized by subject (1 to 30) and activity (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).
